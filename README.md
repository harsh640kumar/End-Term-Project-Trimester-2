# Personal Productivity Dashboard

This is a simple **Personal Productivity Dashboard** made as part of my end-term project.  
The main goal of this project is to help users plan tasks, track their progress, and stay productive using a clean and easy-to-use interface.

The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without any external libraries.

## Features

- Add tasks with different priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks when they are no longer needed
- Visual progress bar that shows overall task completion percentage
- Simple and user-friendly UI

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structure of the dashboard  
- **CSS** – for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – for task management logic and progress tracking

2. Select the priority level.
3. Click on **Add** to add the task.
4. Click "green tick" to mark a task as completed.
